A simple adventure game by Hazelle Malonzo based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: Main Deck, Below Deck, Steering Wheel, Side of Ship (name at least 4 of the classes).
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: unsatisfied (name the classes).
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: unsatisfied (name the method and explain the use of it).
    - Enhancement 2: unsatisfied (name the method and explain the use of it).

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: Main Deck, Below Deck, Steering Wheel, Side of Ship (name at least 4 of the classes).
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: The bucket and silver key.  
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: The bucket and silver key. (describe two examples)
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: The change in locations and the items that the player can pick up. (describe two examples)
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: Visual assets move to replace the text once clicked. (describe two examples)

Asset sources:
- (For each image/audio/video asset used, describe how it was created. What tool did you use to create it? Was it based on another work? If so, how did you change it, and where can we learn more about the original work for comparison? Use [Markdown link syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links).)

Code sources:
- `adventure.js` and `index.html` were created for this project [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly) and edited by me.
- `game.js` was sketched by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly) and rewritten by me.
